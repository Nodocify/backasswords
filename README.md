#Python Backasswords
Thanks to Ben Kurtovic for the idea after reading his blog.

This will obfuscate any python script using Ben Kurtovic's obfuscation method.
I converted it to Python 3 and to take input from a file.

##Dependencies
*Python 3+

##Usage
python3 backasswords.py [script] > output.py
